⚡ Ethereum Flash Stablecoin Transfer Tool

Overview:
The Ethereum Flash Stablecoin Transfer Tool is a lightweight simulator designed to visually demonstrate ERC-20–style token transfers on the Ethereum network.
Built with Python and Tkinter, this project is intended solely for educational, testing, and demonstration purposes — it does not create or send real blockchain transactions.

Creates a visual simulation of Ethereum stablecoin-like transfers between wallet addresses.

Useful for UI/UX demos, developer education, testing scripts, or blockchain training sessions.

Can be run as a Python script or packaged as a standalone Windows executable for easy use.

⚠️ Important Safety & Legal Notice

Read carefully before using.

Never enter your real private keys, seed phrases, or credentials.
This tool does not require or use real wallet access.

All transactions shown are simulated visuals only — they are not recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and carry no real value.

Do not use this tool to mislead others or to create fake transaction records.
It is strictly for educational, testing, or research purposes.

If you use external providers such as Infura or Alchemy, configure testnet API keys only and never include private credentials in your repository.

⚠️ Recommended Use Cases

Teaching how ERC-20 token transfers appear in a wallet or interface.

Testing wallet UIs or blockchain applications in a controlled, safe environment.

Demonstrating smart-contract or token mechanics without using real ETH or tokens.

Creating visual demos for presentations, workshops, or training videos.

⚡ Key Features (Safe & Educational)

Realistic visual simulation of ERC-20 token transfers between addresses.

Configurable token details (name, symbol, balance) for demo customization.

Testnet-compatible integration with providers such as Infura or Alchemy (using test credentials).

Portable executable — run easily on Windows without installing dependencies.

Minimalist Tkinter interface — clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.
